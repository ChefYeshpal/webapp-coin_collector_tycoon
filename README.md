# webapp-coin_collector_tycoon
I think a better name for this would be "Money Maker" cause this is a continuation of a really old project of mine (more like a repository for python) where I basically made a super simple python program in which the user is a beggar, who needs to refill water bottles and sell them at some price. I think I didn't continue it cause I couldn't understand how to add a proper loop statement in the code (for the repeating days) but anyways, I've decided to pick it back up, ofc in TypeScript.

## Things I wanted to add

## Devlogs
- 30 Sept 2025
    - Created repository
    - Tried a more "coin collector tycoon" type of thing, I didn't see it having any special or unique qualities so just deleted it all after like... 45 mins of work?
    - Copied the latest ``MM04.py`` from my MoneyMaker repository (https://github.com/ChefYeshpal/MoneyMaker/blob/master/MM0.4.py)
        - Dang I haven't touched that in 2 whole years... time flies by fast.
- 1 Oct 2025
    - Changed the python code to typescript
